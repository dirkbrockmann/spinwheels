# Spin Wheels

This explorable illustrates some interesting and beautiful properties of oscillators that are spatially arranged on a lattice and interact with their neighbors by phase coupling.

The explorable is part of the [**Complexity Exporables Collection**](https://www.complexity-explorables.org). Fpr more information about the system consult the explorable
